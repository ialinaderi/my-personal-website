# Welcome to My First Open Source Project

My personal website is my first open source project on GitHub developed with Next.js.
You can see this project live on [alinaderi.info](https://alinaderi.info).
This website contains information about my biography, experiences, skills, education, etc.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
